"""mirror — intent echo before execution (held with control).

Attended: gate=required — nothing runs until the owner confirms.
Unattended: the engine infers from accumulated layers, marks inferred=true,
queues the inference for later review (every correction is a delta).

The veto scan reads active never-rules directly (NOT through B7
retrieval): a decayed guardrail may not reach packets, but it still gets
to flag a task that IS the forbidden thing — intent-time alarms are an
audit surface, not an injection surface.
